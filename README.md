History
=================
Yay Mounts was a mount management Addon for World of Warcraft that has stopped being maintained since September 2016. The addon developers were Faldoncow and askander_kt.

Bestride is a continuation of the code, which will hopefully fix some of the bugs as well as repair some deficiencies in the previous code. Also included is the latest ACE3 versions of the libraries used.Â  Code will be gradually refactored up to the released, which will be v1.0

Special mounts are also usable:

* Flying Broom
* Oculus Mount
* Northrend Loaned Mount
* Abyssal Seahorse
* Subdued Seahorse
* Sea Turtle
* ~~Water strider (prioritized)~~
